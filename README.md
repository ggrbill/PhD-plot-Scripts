# PhD-plot-Scripts

My personal plot scripts (in `python`) used to generate graphs for my PhD Thesis (2016).

This repo contains two folders:

- `src`: All python scripts. They use `numpy` and `matplotlib` to manipulate data and plot the graphs.
- `data`: Some `.csv` files examples with data that will be used by the scripts

PS: The scripts are a little bit old, if your are going to use it perhaps it would be better to make some refactors to optimize them.
